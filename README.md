# Echo Room

A small Unity prototype that explores basic player movement, lighting, and a simple ghost replay mechanic that records and replays your past motion.  
I built this project while teaching myself game engine scripting and real-time interaction.

## How it works
- Move with WASD and look around with the mouse  
- Press R to spawn a ghost that retraces your movements  

## Tools and setup
- Unity 2022 LTS  
- C# scripts: PlayerMovement, EchoRecorder, EchoGhost  

## Notes
This was an independent learning project to understand how player input, camera control, and object instantiation work together in Unity.
