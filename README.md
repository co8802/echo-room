# Echo Room 🎮  

A small Unity prototype exploring basic **player movement, lighting, and a “ghost replay” mechanic** that records and replays your past motion.  
Built while learning game-engine scripting and real-time interaction.

## Demo
- Move with **W A S D**, look with mouse  
- Press **R** to replay your ghost trail  

## Tech
- Unity 2022 LTS  
- C# scripts: `PlayerMovement`, `EchoRecorder`, `EchoGhost`  

## Notes
Made as a short experiment to understand camera control, player input, and object instantiation.
